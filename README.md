## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts Doctor Consultancy Fees.

## Motivation
I am a Big Data and data science enthusiast. I started to learn Machine Learning in this hard times and tried to dig deep into the Data science with all mathematical concepts behind the Algorithm to find Best out of this. Finally it is important to work on application(real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The whole code is written in Python 3.8.5. you can run it in lower version as well or find the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install the required libraries and packages run the command in project directory.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Approach to Project
The project is taken from MachineHack Hackathon which I tried to convert in end-end data science project. There is so much learning inside this project and the task is quite challenging because all the fields are categorical. Based on the hackathon site, submission are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Log-Error (RMSLE) error, more specifically, `1-RMSLE`.

## Future Scope
* Optimize flask app.py
* support of Multiple Algorithms
* Database support
